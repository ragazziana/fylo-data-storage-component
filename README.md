## The Challenge


Your challenge is to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

Download the starter code and go through the  `README.md`  file. This will provide further details about the project. The  `style-guide.md`  file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
